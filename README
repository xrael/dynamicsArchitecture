Dynamics simulator architecture

Simulates a very general simulator architecture with dynamics, external forces and torques, flight software, controls,
estimators, and objects for computing reference trajectories.

TO-DO:

1) Think again about MRP switching. Currently, it's being done in the intermediate steps of RK-4 integration.
What happens if there's switching in some of the integration steps? What happens to sigma_dot?
